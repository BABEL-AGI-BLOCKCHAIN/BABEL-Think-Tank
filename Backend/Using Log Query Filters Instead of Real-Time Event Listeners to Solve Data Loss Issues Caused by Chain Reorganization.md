### Using Log Query Filters Instead of Real-Time Event Listeners to Solve Data Loss Issues Caused by Chain Reorganization

#### Key Reasons:

1. **Historical Event Queries Are Unaffected by Chain Reorganization**:

    - When you use `FilterQuery` in go-ethereum or `queryFilter` in ethers.js (referred to as `FilterQuery` here), you are querying log data that has already been confirmed and stored on the blockchain. Even if a chain reorganization occurs, the historical records on the blockchain are still accessible.
    - During reorganization, although some new blocks may be rolled back, the logs that have already been recorded are not lost. You can query logs within a block range to ensure you receive the complete historical data.

2. **Issues with Real-Time Event Listening**:

    - When you listen for events in real-time, some events may be missed or triggered multiple times if a chain reorganization occurs. For example, if a block undergoes reorganization, the events previously received may disappear as the block is rolled back.
    - Real-time listeners may miss certain data, especially if there is no mechanism to handle re-subscription or status confirmation after a reorganization.

3. **How `FilterQuery` Solves the Problem**:
    - By using `FilterQuery` to query historical logs, you can accurately retrieve all events within a specified block range, avoiding the data loss risks that come with real-time listeners. Even if a reorganization occurs, querying historical events allows you to restore data consistency.
    - By specifying `FromBlock` and `ToBlock`, you can precisely query the block range you need, ensuring that you donâ€™t miss any historical data during a chain reorganization.

#### Conclusion:

By using `FilterQuery` to query historical logs, you can avoid data loss caused by chain reorganization, as you're querying data that has already been stored and confirmed on the blockchain. Real-time event listeners depend on live data streams, and chain reorganizations may cause you to miss some events. Therefore, querying historical logs is a more reliable way to ensure data integrity.
