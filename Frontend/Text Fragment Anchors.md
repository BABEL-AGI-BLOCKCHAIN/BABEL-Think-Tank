# #:~: Syntax for Text Fragment Anchors

## **1. What is #:~: Syntax?**

#:~:text=keyword is used to specify a **text fragment** in the webpage URL, allowing the browser to **automatically highlight specific text** after opening the page.

### **Example**

Suppose you visit this URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heights_of_presidents_and_presidential_candidates_of_the_United_States#:~:text=The%20tallest%20U.S.%20president%20was

After opening it, the browser will automatically scroll to the text **"The tallest U.S. president was"** and highlight it.

## **2. Syntax Breakdown**

#:~:text=keyword1,keyword2

-   #:~: indicates a URL fragment identifier.
-   text=keyword1,keyword2:
    -   keyword1: the starting text to search for.
    -   keyword2 (optional): the ending text to search for, helping to match a more specific paragraph.

### **Examples**

1. **Highlighting a single word**
   https://example.com/page#:~:text=blockchain

    Effect: The browser will open example.com/page and automatically highlight the word **"blockchain"**.

2. **Highlighting an entire sentence**
   https://example.com/page#:~:text=blockchain%20technology%20is%20revolutionary

    Effect: The browser will match and highlight the entire sentence **"blockchain technology is revolutionary"**.

3. **Highlighting an entire paragraph (start + end)**
   https://example.com/page#:~:text=blockchain,financial%20system

    Effect: The browser will highlight everything between **"blockchain"** and **"financial system"**.

## **4. How to Generate #:~: URLs?**

Chrome has a built-in feature to generate them:

1. Open a webpage in Chrome.
2. Select the text you want to highlight.
3. Right-click → **"Copy Link to Highlight"**.
4. You will get a URL with #:~:text= in it, which you can share. When others click it, the same text will be highlighted.

## **5. Practical Use Cases**

-   **Precisely target content** in articles and jump directly to key points.
-   **Improve SEO**, as search engines can use #:~: to take users directly to the relevant part of a page, improving user experience.
-   **Easily share specific sections** in technical documentation, wikis, or FAQs.

## **6. Limitations**

-   Only works for **visible text**, not matching HTML code or hidden text.
-   Does not work for **dynamically loaded content** (e.g., text generated by JavaScript).
-   Requires **browser support**, Safari and Firefox may not handle it correctly.
